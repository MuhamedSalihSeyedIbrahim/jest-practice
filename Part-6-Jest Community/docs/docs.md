<p><a href="https://github.com/jest-community">jest-community</a> is a new GitHub organization for high quality Jest additions curated by Jest maintainers and collaborators. It already features some of our favorite projects, to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest">vscode-jest</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended">jest-extended</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest">eslint-plugin-jest</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest">awesome-jest</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Community projects under one organisation are a great way for Jest to experiment with new ideas/techniques and approaches. Encourage contributions from the community and publish contributions independently at a faster pace.</p>
<p>The jest-community org maintains an <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest">awesome-jest</a> list of great projects and resources related to Jest, this includes all projects not just the ones in the jest-community org.</p>
<p>If you have something awesome to share, feel free to reach out to us! We&apos;d love to share your project on the awesome-jest list (<a href="https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest/pulls">send a PR here</a>) or if you would like to transfer your project to the jest-community org reachout to one of the owners of the org.</p>
